# Other Pieces Worth Looking At

You've probably already read all these if you've somehow stumbled across this.

Just in case you haven't:

* If you like watching talks, Rich Hickey's are brilliant. I don't, but I still
highly recommend "Are We There Yet?" and "The Value of Values"
* Paul Graham's essays are generally brilliant. Definitely check out "Beating
the Averages."
* magic.md introduces some of the game changing "libraries" that are doing things
that would be really difficult in other programming languages
* http://www.braveclojure.com is sort of whimsical and silly, but it's probably much
better as a learning resource than my stuff. It's important to keep your brain
amused to keep it paying attention.
