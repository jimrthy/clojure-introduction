# clj-tut

Quick overview of clojure.

## Usage

This is the basic project structure.

If you're curious about the 'why', I've jotted down some basic ideas
in doc/intro.md.

If you'd rather jump right into the coding basics, start with
src/clj-tut/core.clj.

If you're feeling adventurous, install leiningen from leiningen.org.
Run `lein repl` here in the root directory.
Type the forms from core.clj there to see what they produce.

If you're feeling *really* adventurous, set up an editor that
understands clojure (lighttable is a great one) and follow along
dynamically.

project.clj is the rough equivalent of Visual Studio's .csproj
or java's pom.xml. It describes all the project dependencies,
where the source code lives,
different settings for different kinds of builds (called profiles),
and where the output should go.
